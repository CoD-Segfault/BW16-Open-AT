# BW16-Open-AT
This is an alternative to the B&amp;T AT firmware for the wardriver.uk rev3. This version offers improvements in WiFi encryption identification, particularly when WPA3 is in use. You will need to update your wardriver.uk board (derivatives included) to at least 1.3.0b1 at https://github.com/JosephHewitt/wardriver_rev3 for encryption identification to work properly.

You can follow the directions at https://www.amebaiot.com/en/amebad-bw16-arduino-getting-started/ to flash your RTLduino/BW16 modules.
